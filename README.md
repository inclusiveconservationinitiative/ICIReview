>Analysis and documentation of the Third National Reports on Biodiversity to the CBD. The following data was produced using the reports analyzer to compare relevant IPLC oriented questions between key geography countries. Some countries are not included due to gaps in coverage of the CBD reports analyzer tool.

25th to 75th Percentile Yellow (10-16);
